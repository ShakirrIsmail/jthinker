Package that contains various useful data types. This package is designed
as an extension to java.util package and is one of jThinker's core packages.
Thus, it shouldn't refer to any other jThinker's packages. Ideally,
it should depend only on java.lang and java.util, but dependencies on
any standard java libraries is acceptable. Dependencies on any jThinker
code are not, so if some class is going to use functionality of some,
it's better be placed somewhere else.
